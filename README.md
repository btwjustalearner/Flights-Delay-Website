## PROJECT SUMMARY

This project is on flights delays in US 2018. As the amount of travel increases in modern society, the flight delay has become a  problem for the There are many flight carriers in the US. A brilliant flight information provider would be the FLight Information Display System (FIDS). Here we would like to implement another information provider on the website rather than in the airport.

# INF 554 Assignment for 5

Shangting Li: I am not able to get Sozi work on my own PC. Moving on to the next task.

Yan Huang: I will be away for GHC next week so won't be able to make it to the presentation (already informed prof and TAs). Thanks to my teammates for taking the responsibility to deliver the presentation. We discussed, planned for the project and made the slides on Friday and decided on what to talk about on the presentation. My contributions: came up with this topic and provided data. Plotted delay-carrier bar chart and made it SVG. Scheduled timeline and made SVG. Made 'the end' page svg. Put together 10 svgs in one big svg. Created sozi presentation. Discussed and planned for presentaion details with teammates. Documented discussion process in README.

Plan:
demo, video, paper, presentation

2) outline
    1. Introdution to our topic - fligt information. 
    2. Data: The source of Data(csv file), valuable variables in the file including... 
    3. Tool: we are supposed to use d3, R code, python, api to achieve our goal
    4. Sample: Show the sample result and concept of our result.
    5. Timeline
3) topic
US flight information
Only USA: it cost more than $22 billion dollar yearly to airlines.
A delayed flight can be costly to passengers by making them late to their personal scheduled events and commitments. 
A passenger who is delayed on a multi-plane trip could miss a connecting flight. Anger, frustration and even Air rage can occur in delayed passengers.
background: delay, intention

4) data
screenshot

5) data
